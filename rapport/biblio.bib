Major habitat modifications in the St. Lawrence took place in the 1950's (St. Lawrence Seaway and hydroelectric dams), about 30 yr before recruitment started declining; this long delay argues against these perturbations being primary causes of the decline. There is little evidence that commercial fishing and oceanographic changes caused the decline. Overall, we conclude that we do not know what caused the pronounced recruitment decline. We propose research avenues and hypotheses that may advance understanding and emphasize that because of panmixia, the recruitment decline could be species wide.},

	title = {Habitat losses and anthropogenic barriers as a cause of population decline for {American} eel ({Anguilla} rostrata) in the {St}. {Lawrence} watershed, {Canada}},
	abstract = {American eel (Anguilla rostrata) experienced a major decline over past decades. Although fisheries-related mortality could be accurately estimated, there is no global assessment of non-exploitation anthropogenic impacts. Within the St. Lawrence watershed, which contributes about 19\% of the freshwater runoff in the species’ range, we found that more than 8411 dams were erected whose 151 are equipped with hydroelectricity facilities. These obstacles prevent free access to an estimated 12 140 km2 of freshwater habitat. Data analysis from three tributaries in the St. Lawrence watershed allowed evaluating annual productivity and production for female from freshwater habitats. Calculation leads to an estimated escapement of 87.1 kg/km2/year. The extension of this value to the area above barriers in the historic distribution range, suggests that the annual productivity losses could have been as much as 836 500 eels, mostly large fecund females. In comparison, the estuarine fishery at the outlet of the St. Lawrence watershed, with an historical annual peak capture of 340,000 silver eels (1920-2004) represented a loss for the population equivalent to only 40\% of the potential production above dams. By preventing upstream passage, dams are clearly a major cause of abundance decline. Thus, re-opening access should be a priority. Simulations of re-opening some access could potentially contribute for 737 000 spawners per year. This net contribution could however only be obtained with the addition of efficient protection devices against mortalities caused by turbines. These actions appear as being among the most efficient to stop the decline of the species.},

Because of their specific life cycles, which share distant oceanic spawning grounds and continental growth stage, eels are affected by five components of the global change: (a) climate change affecting larval survival and drift, (b) an increase in pollution leading to high levels of contamination exacerbated by their high lipid levels, (c) increasing fragmentation and habitat loss that reduce dramatically the amount of available habitats and induce increased spawner mortality, (d) the appearance of Anguillicola crassus a parasitic alien nematode that impairs spawning success, and (e) the impact of commercial and recreational fisheries for all life stages of eel. In this context, the rapid increases of pressures during the “Great Acceleration” have surpassed the adaptive capacity of eels. This illustrates that cumulative effects of global change can lead to the collapse of species, even in species that have amazingly high adaptive capacities.},

	abstract = {The predatory impacts of Cercopagis pengoi, a planktivorous cladoceran first observed in Lake Ontario in 1998, were assessed by examining patterns in the distribution and population dynamics of macrozooplankton. Specifically, we determined the vertical distribution of C. pengoi in Lake Ontario with respect to other zooplankton species and possible biotic and abiotic controlling factors and used seasonal time series of potential prey species, both before and after C. pengoi invasion, to make inferences about predatory impacts of C. pengoi. The highest abundances of C. pengoi generally occurred at the bottom of the epilimnion or at the top of the metalimnion, and strong diel vertical migration was not observed. The vertical distribution of cyclopoid and calanoid nauplii and copepodids was deeper in 1999 than had historically been observed, which suggest possible avoidance of C. pengoi or localized predatory depletion. Seasonal analyses of normalized biomass size spectra from the Bay of Quinte supported an impact of C. pengoi on organisms {\textless}0.1 μg dry weight. The hypothesized predatory effect on juvenile copepods was supported by an analysis of seasonal time series, where we observed that high abundances of C. pengoi coincided with marked decreases in these groups. Consequently, the presence of C. pengoi likely decreases the production of juvenile copepods both through direct predation and through a shift of copepod vertical distribution to colder waters. Among the cladocerans, only Bosmina longirostris abundance declined in the presence of C. pengoi in the analysis of seasonal time series.},

	abstract = {Invasive plant infestations are projected to rapidly increase with continued habitat fragmentation and climate change. The rate of spread often outpaces land managers’ ability to effectively detect and control infestations. Land stewards need tools that can match the rapid pace and scale of invasive infestations and help prioritize control efforts in the most ecologically important areas and optimize resource allocation. It is imperative that proposed control be informed by the best available ecological information. We present a spatially explicit modeling framework for prioritizing invasive plant treatment. In our case study from Michigan, we employ a multicriteria decision analysis model that synthesizes four critical factors for prioritizing invasive plant stewardship: integrity, biodiversity, resilience, and ecosystem services. Data for quantifying these factors were compiled from several state, federal, university, and non-governmental data sources. The model uses a geographic information system (GIS) to identify places that are impacted by invasive plant infestations that threaten to degrade ecosystem composition, structure, and function; are characterized by high ecosystem integrity; support high biodiversity; are resilient to disturbance; and provide ecosystem services. While specific to Michigan, our modeling framework is broadly applicable. This type of integrated analysis can help inform decisions about allocation of limited resources for numerous biodiversity stewardship and landscape-level conservation planning needs, regardless of geographic location.},

	abstract = {The sustainable provision of ecological products and services, both natural and man-made, faces a substantial threat emanating from invasive plant species (IPS), which inflict considerable economic and ecological harm on a global scale. They are widely recognized as one of the primary drivers of global biodiversity decline and have become the focal point of an increasing number of studies. The integration of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) plays a pivotal role in their detection and classification across a diverse range of research endeavors, emphasizing the critical significance of accounting for the phenological stages of the targeted species when endeavoring to accurately delineate their distribution and occurrences. This study is centered on this fundamental premise, as it endeavors to amass terrestrial data encompassing the phenological stages and spectral attributes of the specified IPS, with the overarching objective of ascertaining the most opportune time frames for their detection. Moreover, it involves the development and validation of a detection and classification algorithm, harnessing a diverse array of RS datasets, including satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery spanning the spectrum from RGB to multispectral and near-infrared (NIR). Taken together, our investigation underscores the advantages of employing an array of RS datasets in conjunction with the phenological stages, offering an economically efficient and adaptable solution for the detection and monitoring of invasive plant species. Such insights hold the potential to inform both present and future policymaking pertaining to the management of invasive species in agricultural and natural ecosystems.},

Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake. Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly. Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1. Arsenite transport in rice roots therefore shares the same highly efficient pathway as silicon, which explains why rice is efficient in arsenic accumulation. Our results provide insight into the uptake mechanism of arsenite in rice and strategies for reducing arsenic accumulation in grain for enhanced food safety.},

Trichomes can be unicellular, bicellular or multicellular, with multiple branches or no branches at all. Unicellular trichomes are generally not secretory, whereas multicellular trichomes include both secretory and non-secretory hairs. The secretory trichomes release secondary metabolites such as artemisinin, which is valuable as an antimalarial agent. Cotton trichomes, also known as cotton fibers, are an important natural product for the textile industry.

Finally, we identify the obstacles and key points for future research on plant trichome development, and speculated the development relationship between the salt glands of halophytes and the trichomes of non-halophytes, which provides a reference for future studying the development of plant epidermal cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {As the main organ for storing water and nutrients, pseudobulbs are of central importance to the growth and survival of orchids. Quantifying nitrogen allocation and resorption of pseudobulbs is important for understanding the survival and adaptation strategies of orchids, but studies in this area are still lacking due to the complicated integration effect between pseudobulbs of different ages. In this study, nitrogen allocation to each organ and nitrogen resorption of Pleione aurita, an epiphytic orchid characterized by annually renewed pseudobulbs, were examined quantitatively under three nitrogen levels using 15N labeling. We found the old pseudobulb can act as a sink for exogenous nitrogen, although it had a much lower sink activity than the developing new pseudobulb. The single leaf accounted for the largest proportion of both exogenous and pseudobulb-stored nitrogen among all organs and in three nitrogen treatments, and the fruit tended to use pseudobulb-stored nitrogen preferentially regardless of exogenous nitrogen supply. The resorption of nitrogen in the leaf and pseudobulb was highly efficient, but decreased with increasing nitrogen supply. Overall, positive biomass accumulation was only observed in plants with exogenous nitrogen supply, while all fruit-bearing plants lost more than 30\% of their biomass after a growing season regardless of nitrogen supply. The P. aurita plants exhibited a strong low nitrogen tolerance with only a slight loss of biomass for those nitrogen deficient and fruitless plants. Surprisingly, an increase in the nitrogen pool of the whole-plant was always observed regardless of biomass loss in fruit-bearing plants after nitrogen addition. Our results suggest an important role of the pseudobulb in the nitrogen economy of P. aurita, and the high dependence of the reproduction process on the pseudobulb-stored nitrogen. The findings will help to understand the adaptive strategies of orchids, and contribute to the conservation of endangered species.},

Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT’s architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them. Additionally, the output of ChatGPT may be difficult to interpret, which could pose challenges for decision-making in data science applications.},

            The adoption of machine learning (ML) and, more specifically, deep learning (DL) applications into all major areas of our lives is underway. The development of trustworthy AI is especially important in medicine due to the large implications for patients’ lives. While trustworthiness concerns various aspects including ethical, transparency and safety requirements, we focus on the importance of data quality (training/test) in DL. Since data quality dictates the behaviour of ML products, evaluating data quality will play a key part in the regulatory approval of medical ML products. We perform a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines using the databases Web of Science, PubMed and ACM Digital Library. We identify 5408 studies, out of which 120 records fulfil our eligibility criteria. From this literature, we synthesise the existing knowledge on data quality frameworks and combine it with the perspective of ML applications in medicine. As a result, we propose the METRIC-framework, a specialised data quality framework for medical training data comprising 15 awareness dimensions, along which developers of medical ML applications should investigate the content of a dataset. This knowledge helps to reduce biases as a major source of unfairness, increase robustness, facilitate interpretability and thus lays the foundation for trustworthy AI in medicine. The METRIC-framework may serve as a base for systematically assessing training datasets, establishing reference datasets, and designing test datasets which has the potential to accelerate the approval of medical ML products.},

We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could transform many fields of biology, ecology, and zoology into "big data" sciences. Motion sensor "camera traps" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2-million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with over 93.8\% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3\% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6\% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving more than 8.4 years (at 40 hours per week) of human labeling effort (i.e. over 17,000 hours) on this 3.2-million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains immediately highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images. Our results suggest that this technology could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.},

	abstract = {L’avancement des connaissances et les progrès dans divers domaines dépendent de la recherche scientifique. L'évolution rapide de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) offre de nouvelles perspectives pour améliorer l’efficacité et les résultats de ces efforts scientifiques. L'IA, notamment l’apprentissage automatique et la manipulation du langage naturel, a le pouvoir de transformer le processus de recherche scientifique. Elle permet d'analyser efficacement de vastes ensembles de données, révélant des modèles complexes qui sont difficiles à détecter manuellement. L'IA stimule également les avancées scientifiques en formulant des hypothèses de recherche. De plus, elle libère les chercheurs en automatisant les tâches répétitives, ce qui leur permet de se concentrer sur les aspects créatifs de leur travail. Cependant, l'intégration de l'IA dans la recherche scientifique soulève des questions et des obstacles importants. La crédibilité des résultats obtenus grâce à l'IA peut être remise en question, et comprendre les choix effectués par les systèmes d'IA peut être complexe pour les chercheurs. Il est donc essentiel de comprendre l'effet de l'IA sur la performance des projets de recherche scientifique, afin de maximiser les avantages tout en atténuant les risques. Notre étude vise à étudier l’effet de l'IA sur la recherche scientifique en utilisant une approche qualitative. Nous avons mené des entretiens approfondis avec des doctorants chercheurs dans le domaine des sciences de gestion. L'analyse des données a été réalisée à l'aide d'une méthode d'analyse de contenu incluant des fréquences de mots, des matrices à condensés pour l'analyse thématique et un croisement matriciel des nœuds avec les sources. En suivant une méthodologie rigoureuse et systématique, nous cherchons à obtenir un aperçu complet des perspectives des chercheurs et à générer des connaissances sur le rôle de l’intégration de l'IA dans la recherche scientifique. Les résultats de notre étude montrent que l'intégration de l'IA dans la recherche scientifique améliore l'efficacité et favorise la découverte de nouvelles significations. Plus précisément, elle présente plusieurs avantages notables : une efficacité accrue grâce à l'automatisation des tâches répétitives ; une découverte de nouvelles significations, optimisée par l'analyse de structures de données avancées ; et une amélioration des performances, se manifestant par un impact positif sur la génération d'hypothèses et la conception d'expériences. Ces résultats corroborent les avantages soulignés dans la littérature existante, tout en mettant en lumière des enjeux éthiques et réglementaires importants. 
  
The advancement of knowledge and progress in various fields depend on scientific research. The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to improve the efficiency and results of these scientific efforts. AI, including machine learning and natural language manipulation, has the power to transform the scientific research process. It allows for the efficient analysis of large data sets, revealing complex patterns that are difficult to detect manually. AI also drives scientific advances by formulating research hypotheses. In addition, it frees up researchers by automating repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of their work. However, the integration of AI into scientific research raises significant questions and obstacles. The credibility of the results obtained through AI can be questioned, and understanding the choices made by AI systems can be complex for researchers. It is therefore essential to understand the effect of AI on the performance of scientific research projects, in order to maximize benefits while mitigating risks. Our study aims to investigate the effect of AI on scientific research using a qualitative approach. We will conduct in-depth interviews with doctoral students who are researchers in the field of management sciences. Data analysis was performed using a content analysis method, including word frequencies, condensed matrices for thematic analysis, and matrix cross-referencing of nodes with sources. By following a rigorous and systematic methodology, we seek to gain a comprehensive overview of researchers' perspectives and generate knowledge about the role of integrating AI into scientific research. The results of our study show that the integration of AI into scientific research improves efficiency and promotes the discovery of new meanings. Specifically, it has several notable advantages: increased efficiency through automation of repetitive tasks; the discovery of new meanings, powered by the analysis of advanced data structures; and improved performance, manifested in a positive impact on hypothesis generation and experiment design. These results corroborate the benefits highlighted in the existing literature while highlighting important ethical and regulatory issues.},

At the same time the deep learning community began to realize that training models with more and more parameters requires a lot of energy and as a consequence GHG emissions. To our knowledge, questioning the complete net environmental impacts of AI solutions for the environment (AI for Green), and not only GHG, has never been addressed directly. In this article, we propose to study the possible negative impacts of AI for Green. First, we review the different types of AI impacts, then we present the different methodologies used to assess those impacts, and show how to apply life cycle assessment to AI services. Finally, we discuss how to assess the environmental usefulness of a general AI service, and point out the limitations of existing work in AI for Green.},

	abstract = {The use of English as the common language of science represents a major impediment to maximising the contribution of non-native English speakers to science. Yet few studies have quantified the consequences of language barriers on the career development of researchers who are non-native English speakers. By surveying 908 researchers in environmental sciences, this study estimates and compares the amount of effort required to conduct scientific activities in English between researchers from different countries and, thus, different linguistic and economic backgrounds. Our survey demonstrates that non-native English speakers, especially early in their careers, spend more effort than native English speakers in conducting scientific activities, from reading and writing papers and preparing presentations in English, to disseminating research in multiple languages. Language barriers can also cause them not to attend, or give oral presentations at, international conferences conducted in English. We urge scientific communities to recognise and tackle these disadvantages to release the untapped potential of non-native English speakers in science. This study also proposes potential solutions that can be implemented today by individuals, institutions, journals, funders, and conferences.

            There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (

In this context, we introduce WildLIVE!, a dynamic biomonitoring and citizen science project. In WildLIVE!, participants analyze a vast array of images from a long-term camera trapping project in Bolivia to investigate the impacts of shifting environmental factors on wildlife. From 2020 to 2023, more than 850 participants registered for WildLIVE!, contributing nearly 9,000 hours of voluntary work. We explore the motivators and sentiments of participant engagement and discuss the key strategies that have contributed to the project’s initial success. The findings from a questionnaire highlight that the primary motivational factors for our participants are understanding and knowledge, as well as engagement and commitment. However, expressions of positive and negative sentiments can be found regarding involvement. Participants appeared to be driven primarily by a desire for intellectual growth and emotional fulfillment. Factors crucial to the success of this digital citizen science project include media exposure, creating emotional connections through virtual and in-person communication with participants, and visibility on public citizen science portals. Moreover, the project’s labeled dataset serves as a valuable resource for machine learning, aiding the development of a new platform that is compliant with the FAIR principles. WildLIVE! not only contributes to outcomes in science, society, and nature conservation, but also demonstrates the potential of creating a collaborative bridge between the general public, scientific research, biodiversity conservation, and advanced technological applications.},

            Editor’s summary
            
              Reports of declining insect populations have received widespread media attention, but evidence for declines has been variable across regions and taxonomic groups. Edwards
              et al
              . examined trends in the most surveyed taxon: butterflies (see the Perspective by Inouye). Combining data from 35 citizen science programs across the continental US, the authors found declines in overall butterfly abundance over the past 20 years across almost all major regions. Two-thirds of studied species showed declines of more than 10\%. Many insects have the potential for rapid population growth and recovery, but habitat restoration, species-specific interventions, and reducing pesticide use are all likely needed to curb population declines. —Bianca Lopez},

              The effect of temperature on the reproduction and development of
              Busseola fusca
              was studied under laboratory conditions. Single male–female pairs were confined to oviposition chambers kept at 15, 20, 26 and 30 ± 1°C and a 14L:10D photoperiod. Data on reproduction parameters were captured daily. Oviposition occurred at all the mentioned temperatures but no fertility was recorded at 30°C. The total number of eggs laid per female moth was between 300 and 400 and the optimum temperature for oviposition and fertility was between 20 and 26°C. Larval development was studied at five different temperature regimes, i.e. 15, 18, 20, 26 and 30 ± 1°C and a 14L:10D photoperiod. The most favourable temperature as well as the upper threshold temperature for larval development was between 26 and 30°C. Total development period was 152.6–52.6 days, respectively, at 15°C, and 26–30°C. The thermal constants for
              B. fusca
              was 99.50, 536.48, 246.25 and 893.66°D and lower temperature thresholds were 10.36, 8.14, 8.99 and 8.84°C, for completion of the egg, larval, pupal and egg-to-adult stages, respectively. Results on the thermal constants and lower and upper threshold temperatures of
              B. fusca
              can be used to predict the impact of climate change on the distribution and population growth of this pest.},

            Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the most studied, diverse, and widespread animal groups, making them an ideal model for climate change research. They are a particularly informative model for studying the effects of climate change on species ecology because they are ectotherms that thermoregulate with a suite of physiological, behavioural, and phenotypic traits. While some species have been negatively impacted by climatic disturbances, others have prospered, largely in accordance with their diversity in life‐history traits. Here we take advantage of a large repertoire of studies on butterflies and moths to provide a review of the many ways in which climate change is impacting insects, animals, and ecosystems. By studying these climate‐based impacts on ecological processes of Lepidoptera, we propose appropriate strategies for species conservation and habitat management broadly across animals.},

            Global climate change has been identified as a potential driver of observed insect declines, yet in many regions, there are critical data gaps that make it difficult to assess how communities are responding to climate change. Poleward regions are of particular interest because warming is most rapid while biodiversity data are most sparse. Building on recent advances in occupancy modeling of presence‐only data, we reconstructed 50 years (1970–2019) of butterfly occupancy trends in response to rising minimum temperatures in one of the most under‐sampled regions of North America. Among 90 modeled species, we found that cold‐adapted species are far more often in decline compared with their warm‐adapted, more southernly distributed counterparts. Furthermore, in a post hoc analysis using species' traits, we find that species' range‐wide average annual temperature is the only consistent predictor of occupancy changes. Species with warmer ranges were most likely to be increasing in occupancy. This trend results in the majority of butterflies increasing in occupancy probability over the last 50 years. Our results provide the first look at macroscale butterfly biodiversity shifts in high‐latitude North America. These results highlight the potential of leveraging the wealth of presence‐only data, the most abundant source of biodiversity data, for inferring changes in species distributions.},

                  Interactions between herbivorous insects and their host plants that are limited in time are widespread. Therefore, many insect–plant interactions result in a developmental race, where herbivores need to complete their development before plants become unsuitable, while plants strive to minimize damage from herbivores by outgrowing them.
                
                
                  When spring phenologies of interacting species change asymmetrically in response to climate warming, there will be a change in the developmental state of host plants at the time of insect herbivore emergence. In combination with altered temperatures during the subsequent developmental period, this is likely to affect interaction strength as well as fitness of interacting species.
                
                
                  
                    Here, we experimentally explore whether the combined effect of phenological matching and thermal conditions influence the outcome of an insect–host interaction. We manipulated both developmental stages of the host plants at the start of the interaction and temperature during the subsequent developmental period in a model system of a herbivorous butterfly,
                    Anthocharis cardamines,
                    and five of its Brassicaceae host plant species.
                  
                
                
                  Larval performance characteristics were favoured by earlier stages of host plants at oviposition as well as by higher developmental temperatures on most of the host species. The probability of a larva needing a second host plant covered the full range from no influence of either phenological matching or temperature to strong effects of both factors, and complex interactions between them. The probability of a plant outgrowing a larva was dependent only on the species identity.
                
                
                  This study demonstrates that climatic variation can influence the outcome of consumer–resource interactions in multiple ways and that its effects differ among host plant species. Therefore, climate warming is likely to change the temporal match between larval and plant development in some plant species, but not in the others. This is likely to have important implications for host plant use and possibly influence competitive relationships.},
